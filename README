Problem: The Valid Anagram

Description:

Write a function to determine if two provided strings are anagrams of each other.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Examples:

Input: s = "listen", t = "silent" -> Output: True

Input: s = "rat", t = "car" -> Output: False

Requirements:

Preferred language(Java, Javascript, Typescript , C, C++)

Briefly explain your logic/approach.

State the Time Complexity and Space Complexity of your solution.






Explanation of Code:

count[26] keeps track of the frequency of lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'.

Increment for each character in s.

Decrement for each character in t.

If any count becomes negative, t has extra characters → return false.

If loop finishes without returning false, they are anagrams → return true.

Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity:

O(n), where n is the length of the strings (single pass for counting and decrementing).

Space Complexity:

O(1) → We use a fixed-size array of 26 integers, independent of input size.

Note: If strings contain all ASCII characters, use int count[128] instead.
